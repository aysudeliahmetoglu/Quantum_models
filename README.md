# Quantum Models and Circuits

This repository contains example codes for various quantum models and circuits. It is designed to make the understanding of quantum circuits and algorithms easier by providing different examples. The repository includes quantum circuits created using popular quantum programming libraries like Qiskit.

## Content

- **Quantum Circuits**: Examples of creating quantum circuits and running simulations.
- **Quantum Algorithms**: Examples of quantum algorithms (Hadamard gate, superposition, measurement, etc.).
- **Visualization**: Visualization of quantum circuits and simulation results.
- **Simulations**: Testing quantum circuits using simulators instead of real hardware.

## Getting Started

To use this repository and create your own quantum circuits, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to install the following libraries:

- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) (Quantum computing framework)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (For data visualization)

You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install qiskit matplotlib
```

### Usage
Clone the Repository: First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/aysudeliahmetoglu/QuantumModels.git
```
Create a Quantum Circuit: Open the quantum_model.py file in your preferred editor (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm). The script demonstrates how to create a quantum circuit, apply quantum gates (like Hadamard), and perform measurements.

Run the Simulation: To simulate the quantum circuit, you can execute the quantum_model.py file:

```bash

python quantum_model.py
```
This will run the quantum circuit on a local simulator and display the results using a histogram.

View the Visualization: The script will generate and display a histogram showing the result of the quantum measurements. You can also save the histogram as an image by modifying the script.
