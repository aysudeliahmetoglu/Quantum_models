# Quantum Models and Circuits

This repository contains example codes for various quantum models and circuits. It is designed to make the understanding of quantum circuits and algorithms easier by providing different examples. The repository includes quantum circuits created using popular quantum programming libraries like Qiskit.

## Content

- **Quantum Circuits**: Examples of creating quantum circuits and running simulations.
- **Quantum Algorithms**: Examples of quantum algorithms (Hadamard gate, superposition, measurement, etc.).
- **Visualization**: Visualization of quantum circuits and simulation results.
- **Simulations**: Testing quantum circuits using simulators instead of real hardware.

## Getting Started

To use this repository and create your own quantum circuits, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to install the following libraries:

- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) (Quantum computing framework)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (For data visualization)

You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install qiskit matplotlib
